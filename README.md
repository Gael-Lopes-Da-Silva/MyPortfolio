<p align="center">ðŸ’¼ This is my portfolio. I'm not a profesional so it can contain code that can hurt your eyes.</p>

<p align="center">ðŸª¨ My portfolio is not set in stone and I want to make it look better and more minimalistic without making it liking of information. So I have some models to work on. You can find them <a href="models/README.md">here</a>.</p>
